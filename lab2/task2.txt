Task 2: Implement Movie Management and Oscar Services API

Based on the OpenAPI specification in openapi-specification.yaml, create a web application that implements the following services:

1. Movie Management Service - RESTful API for managing a collection of Movie objects:
   - GET /movies - Get all movies with filtering, sorting, and pagination
   - POST /movies - Create a new movie
   - GET /movies/{id} - Get movie by ID
   - PUT /movies/{id} - Update movie by ID
   - DELETE /movies/{id} - Delete movie by ID
   - GET /movies/average-length - Calculate average movie length
   - GET /movies/count-by-operator - Count movies with operator greater than specified
   - GET /movies/filter-by-operator - Get movies with operator greater than specified

2. Oscar Service - Additional operations related to screenwriters and movie awards:
   - GET /oscar/screenwriters/get-loosers - Get screenwriters with no Oscar wins
   - PATCH /oscar/movies/honor-by-length/{min-length}/oscars-to-add - Add Oscars to movies by length

Technical Requirements:
- All request/response bodies must use XML format
- All parameters must be passed via URL (path/query parameters)
- Implement proper validation and error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Support filtering by any field combination in GET /movies
- Support sorting by any field in GET /movies
- Implement pagination with page size and page number in GET /movies
- All auto-generated fields (id, creationDate) should be handled automatically by the server
- XML is the required data format for all operations

Data Models:
- Movie: id, name, coordinates, creationDate, oscarsCount, goldenPalmCount, length, genre, operator
- Coordinates: x, y
- Person: name, birthday, height
- MovieGenre enum: WESTERN, MUSICAL, ADVENTURE, HORROR, SCIENCE_FICTION

Implementation Notes:
- Use a suitable web framework for your preferred language
- Store data in memory (no persistence required)
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Ensure all validation constraints from the specification are implemented
